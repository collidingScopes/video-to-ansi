Turn videos into ASCII pixel art! Use your webcam feed or upload a video, then use the controls to adjust the colors, resolution, text style, etc...

The code used to create the animation is quite resource-intensive, so it may run with some lag if your computer doesn't have enough computing power, too many tabs open, low battery, etc.

This project is coded using Javascript, HTML canvas, and CSS. Video creation and encoding is done using mp4 muxer.

I do not have access to any of the videos that you upload here, as all processing is done "client-side" (i.e., no videos or images are saved/stored by me â€” they stay on your computer only).
